# Task 1
I pull a postgis image which already has PostgreSQL and postgis already and do the query on the docker container. I wrote the SQL function in `func1.sql`. More detail on the step by step commands I executed are in `task1.md`.  
# Task 2
I use the same container and I wrote the code in `main.go`. The idea is to setup a simple HTTP server and get request for spots and give a JSON response.
